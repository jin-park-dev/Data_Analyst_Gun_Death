# Exploring gun death data in the US

In this project I look at dataset from FiveThirtyEight of gun death from 2012 to 2014 to explore.

I looked by

	• Month, homicide
	• Month, suicide
	• Intent of gun
		○ By Gender
		○ By Race
		○ By Education level
	• Link between education and intent.

First part is purely done on python.
Second part is done using python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

My full analysis is on (Place holder)

TLDR: (Place holder)
